                            If you&rsquo;re serious about coding, or you want to start out with a solid tool to code
                            with, I strongly recommend Coda 2 for Mac. A beautiful User Interface with tabbed
                            navigation, a super sidebar, and a simple layout. The features are outrageous and extensive,
                            with code folding, smart complete, auto indentation, GIT integration, a built-in terminal,
                            iCloud support &mdash; to name a few. The features seem to be endless.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I use Coda 2 for all of my courses &amp; tutorials, and if you decide to use Coda 2 as your
                            editor of choice, it would greatly benefit you when taking my courses. The price of the
                            editor weighs in at $75, but it&rsquo;s worth every penny &mdash; in my honest opinion.

                        <p>
                            This tool should go without saying. But if I have to explain &mdash; you
                            <strong>need</strong> this tool. I use it 24/7 &mdash; literally. Dropbox is where I store
                            my personal &amp; business related data. It's accessible anywhere, and regularly backs up my
                            important information.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Because my data is accessible anywhere, Dropbox allows me to work on a client project at
                            home, on the bus, in a coffee shop, or at a friend's house. It's truly a gem of a tool, and
                            I think you'll believe me.
                        </p>
